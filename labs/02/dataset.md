# Open Data Lab (2)

## Task 1 and 2 Select and describe a Dataset

- Gründungslandkarte NRW  
- [Source](https://open.nrw/dataset/gr__ndungslandkarte_nrw_1719229083)
- Format: CSV
- 490 rows / 3 columns 
- Basic Statistics:
  - 489 Companies in the dataset
- Lists newly founded companies in NRW
- Updated yearly
- CC-0


## Task 3 Augment the Dataset
Gründungen in Duisburg [Source 2](https://open.nrw/dataset/grundungen-in-duisburg-du)

- Both datasets describe companies that were founded in a specific region.
- You could compare the number of companies founded in Duisburg in 2020 with those founded in 2025.
- How would I transfer the Datasets to make them compareable?
  1. First, clean the datasets to include only relevant data for my question → only include companies that were founded in Duisburg.
  2. Compare the number of companies in both datasets → how many were founded in the 2020 CSV and the 2025 CSV.

## Task 4 Review the Dataset Using FAIR Principles
Findable? <br>
